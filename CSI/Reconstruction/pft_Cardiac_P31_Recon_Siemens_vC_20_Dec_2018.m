function pft_Cardiac_P31_Recon_Siemens_vC_20_Dec_2018(Home, Root, SubFolder, BRUN)
% TITLE:        Cardiac 31P MR Spectroscopy Reconstruction Code SIEMENS
% PURPOSE:      Uses Siemens data import scripts to import cardiac 31P data from a DICOM file, 
%               performs post-processing, and saves the resulting data in .txt format for jMRUI import. 
%
% REQUIREMENTS: 
%
% MATLAB Image Toolbox, MATLAB Signal Toolbox. 
% Also requires FID-A MATLAB scripts - 'SiemensCsaReadFid' and 'SiemensCsaParse' - to be 
% in the path (cite FID-A MRM paper), along with Chen's ACME scripts and the Wiegers correlation method script.
